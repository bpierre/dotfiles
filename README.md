# My dotfiles

The .vimrc config assumes that:

- [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) is installed
- iTerm colors are defined using the [base16-default.dark theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2)

The `dotjs` directory is meant to be used with dotjs: https://github.com/rlr/dotjs-addon
